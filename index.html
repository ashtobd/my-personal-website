    <p>My name is Brian Ashton. I am married to an amazing wife and I am the proud father of two beautiful children.
        I have always been interested in technology and, after spending ten years in my previous career, have decided
        to pursue my dream of being a software engineer by attending <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School!</a>

        projects on this webpage.
